## 🌍 Project Overview

The Integrated Digital Weather System (IDWS) is a mobile-based, AI-powered platform designed to deliver tailored, climate-smart agricultural advisories to smallholder farmers in Malawi.

The system addresses critical gaps in localized weather information, land-use advice, and digital accessibility, ensuring that farmers can make informed decisions to improve productivity and climate resilience.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Real-time, localized weather forecasts  
- ✅ Data-driven crop suitability and land recommendations  
- ✅ Smart irrigation scheduling for water conservation  
- ✅ Local knowledge integration for culturally relevant advice  
- ✅ Voice features and offline capability for rural areas

## 🔄 How the System Works

The system operates on an **Input–Processing–Output** model:

### 🗂 Data Inputs:
- **Meteorological Data**: Seasonal forecasts, short-term weather updates  
- **Land and Soil Data**: Moisture, pH, nutrients, agro-climatic zones  
- **Regional Characteristics**: Historical crop performance, elevation, risk zones  
- **Farmer-Reported Information**: Land size, crop types, farming practices  
- **Indigenous Knowledge**: Community-specific insights on climate patterns  

### 🧠 Data Processing:
- AI algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Trees) predict crop suitability, irrigation needs, and best practices  
- Hybrid cloud-edge architecture enables real-time decision-making with offline support  
- Context-awareness module adjusts recommendations based on location and user behavior  

### 📲 System Outputs:
- Localized weather forecasts and land condition reports  
- Tailored advisories: Planting windows, irrigation schedules, crop selection  
- **Digital Crop Calendars** generated based on integrated seasonal forecasts and input data  
- Early warnings for droughts, floods, and pest risks  
- Farm operation tracking via the mobile interface
